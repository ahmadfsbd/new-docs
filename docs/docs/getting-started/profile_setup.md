<!-- ## **Setting up a profile** -->

When first set up, users will get an email from Google (to their normal email address). This will have a [_username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk_](mailto:username@genesandhealth.qmul.ac.uk) username. You need to Add this as a Profile in Google Chrome. Please do not try to use any other browser than Google Chrome! 

:::note

This username is not an email address, and we will not send email to it. It cannot receive email; it is just a username for the TRE.

:::

Once you have done this, go to `Manage Your Account` and `Security` and turn 2 Step Verification on. You will need to enter a phone number and get a code by SMS/text message. You cannot access the TRE without this enabled.
