## Data import

Sometimes it is necessary to get data or code into the TRE. As the
TRE is shut off from the internet this presents a challenge. This guide
explains how to do this.

### Copying text in
A small amount of text can be pasted in from external systems using the Clipboard tool. This does not allow copy/paste out. This might be useful should you need to copy in a difficult to write function for example. 

### Getting user data into the TRE

You can upload data to your Sandbox specific green-uploads bucket, which you can find using the widget below:

<SandboxSelector />


Once uploaded, please email [hgi@sanger.ac.uk](mailto:hgi@sanger.ac.uk) with the names of the files/directories you'd like to be transferred and which Sandbox you like them to be transferred to.

:::tip
Please be aware at present, all users in your sandbox can see all data
that is being stored in the `green` library. For this reason, it is important that you do not upload any data that you do not want other users to see for example, individual level data.
