You might be wondering how do I get my results of my analytical code 
out into the world so they can be used in publications or other studies. 

## What is allowed out?
Individual level data is not allowed out of the TRE. Any data out requests are reviewed by the Genes & Health core team to make sure they do not contain individual level data. Summary statistics, graphs etc are all usually fine.
